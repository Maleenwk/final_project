# Adventure Bingo

Adventure Bingo is an interactive bingo-style web app built with Python and Streamlit. The project allows users to generate bingo boards filled with diverse prompts from categories such as Social, Wellbeing, Active, Lifetime Goals, Creativity, and Everyday Adventures.

What you can do so far:

•	Generate a brand-new randomized bingo board of your chosen size.

•	Mark off tiles as you complete them with simple checkboxes.

•	Watch your progress grow with a dynamic progress bar.

•	Save your board as JSON files.

•	Reload saved boards to pick up right where you left off.

# Installation

Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

In Terminal run:
```
streamlit run adventure_Bingo.py
```
Streamlit will start a local server and print something like:
 
> You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
> Local URL: [Local URL]
> Network URL: [Network URL]

Your Browser will automatically open at [Local URL]

On the Local server you can interact with the app through the streamlit UI.

To stop Streamlit in the PyCharm terminal, press Ctrl+C. That stops the Streamlit server and brings you back to your normal project shell in the same terminal.
